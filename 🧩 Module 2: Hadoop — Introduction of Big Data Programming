Topic 1: Introduction to Hadoop and Its Ecosystem
📘 Concept Explanation

Hadoop is an open-source framework developed by the Apache Software Foundation for distributed storage and processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models.

It was inspired by Google’s MapReduce and Google File System (GFS) papers.

🔹 1. Why Hadoop?

Traditional systems couldn’t handle huge, unstructured, and fast-growing data (Big Data).
Hadoop solves this by:

Storing massive data reliably across many machines (using HDFS).

Processing data in parallel efficiently (using MapReduce).

Scalability: Add more nodes easily.

Fault Tolerance: Data automatically replicated to avoid loss.

🔹 2. Core Components of Hadoop

HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) –
Used for storing large files across distributed nodes.

YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) –
Manages and allocates cluster resources.

MapReduce –
Programming model to process data in parallel.

Hadoop Common –
Set of shared libraries and utilities supporting the other modules.

🔹 3. Hadoop Ecosystem

The Hadoop ecosystem includes various tools built around the core Hadoop framework:

Layer	Tools	Purpose
Data Storage	HDFS, HBase	Distributed file and NoSQL storage
Data Processing	MapReduce, Spark, Pig	Batch and real-time processing
Data Querying	Hive, Impala, Drill	SQL-like queries
Data Ingestion	Sqoop, Flume	Import/export data
Data Workflow	Oozie, Airflow	Pipeline scheduling
Monitoring	Ambari, Zookeeper	Cluster management
🔹 4. Hadoop Versions

Hadoop 1.x: MapReduce + HDFS

Hadoop 2.x: Introduced YARN for better resource management

Hadoop 3.x: Improved scalability, erasure coding, and multiple NameNodes

🔹 5. Key Features

Scalability – Works from a few nodes to thousands

Cost-Effective – Runs on commodity hardware

High Availability – Replication ensures no data loss

Data Locality Optimization – Moves computation to data, not data to computation
