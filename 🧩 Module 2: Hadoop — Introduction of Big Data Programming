Topic 1: Introduction to Hadoop and Its Ecosystem
📘 Concept Explanation

Hadoop is an open-source framework developed by the Apache Software Foundation for distributed storage and processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models.

It was inspired by Google’s MapReduce and Google File System (GFS) papers.

🔹 1. Why Hadoop?

Traditional systems couldn’t handle huge, unstructured, and fast-growing data (Big Data).
Hadoop solves this by:

Storing massive data reliably across many machines (using HDFS).

Processing data in parallel efficiently (using MapReduce).

Scalability: Add more nodes easily.

Fault Tolerance: Data automatically replicated to avoid loss.

🔹 2. Core Components of Hadoop

HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) –
Used for storing large files across distributed nodes.

YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) –
Manages and allocates cluster resources.

MapReduce –
Programming model to process data in parallel.

Hadoop Common –
Set of shared libraries and utilities supporting the other modules.

🔹 3. Hadoop Ecosystem

The Hadoop ecosystem includes various tools built around the core Hadoop framework:

Layer	Tools	Purpose
Data Storage	HDFS, HBase	Distributed file and NoSQL storage
Data Processing	MapReduce, Spark, Pig	Batch and real-time processing
Data Querying	Hive, Impala, Drill	SQL-like queries
Data Ingestion	Sqoop, Flume	Import/export data

🔹 4. Hadoop Versions

Hadoop 1.x: MapReduce + HDFS

Topic 2: The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) Overview
📘 Concept Explanation

The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is the primary storage system of Hadoop.
It is designed to store huge datasets reliably and stream those datasets at high bandwidth to user applications — all across clusters of inexpensive machines.

🔹 1. What is HDFS?

HDFS is a distributed file system that splits large files into blocks (default 128 MB or 256 MB).

These blocks are stored across multiple nodes in the cluster.

Each block is replicated (default replication factor = 3) to ensure fault tolerance.

🔹 2. Core Components of HDFS

NameNode (Master Node)

Maintains metadata (info about files, directories, and block locations).

Controls access to files.

Does not store actual data.

DataNode (Worker Node)

Stores actual data blocks.

Periodically reports block health and status to the NameNode.

Secondary NameNode

Checkpoint node, not a backup of the NameNode.

Periodically merges edit logs and fsimage to prevent the NameNode from becoming overloaded.

🔹 3. Features of HDFS

High Fault Tolerance: Data replication ensures data availability even if a node fails.

High Throughput: Optimized for batch processing rather than low latency.

Scalability: Can store petabytes of data by adding nodes.

Data Locality: Computation occurs near where data is stored to minimize data transfer.

🔹 4. HDFS Block Concept

Large files are split into fixed-size blocks for storage.

Each block is stored on different DataNodes for parallel processing.

Example: A 512 MB file with 128 MB block size → 4 blocks stored across different nodes.

🔹 5. Fault Tolerance

If one DataNode fails, Hadoop automatically retrieves data from another replica.

Heartbeats from DataNodes help NameNode track health of nodes.

Rack Awareness ensures replicas are placed across different racks for network reliability.

C. Periodically merges edit logs with fsimage
D. Manages resource allocation

Q4. What ensures that data remains available even if one node fails?

B. Replication ensures fault tolerance.

C. Data locality minimizes data transfer by moving computation near data.

Topic 3: HDFS Architecture and Working
📘 Concept Explanation

The HDFS Architecture is built around a Master–Slave model, designed to handle large-scale distributed storage.
It ensures high availability, fault tolerance, and scalable data access by distributing data across multiple nodes.

🔹 1. HDFS Architecture Overview

HDFS consists of two types of nodes operating in a cluster:

Master Node → NameNode

Manages metadata (file names, permissions, block locations).

Keeps namespace hierarchy (like a directory structure).

Controls client access to files.

Slave Nodes → DataNodes

Store actual data blocks.

Send heartbeats and block reports to NameNode periodically.

A Hadoop cluster typically follows this structure:

Client ↔ NameNode (Master)
           ↕
        DataNodes (Workers)

🔹 2. File Read and Write Process

A. Writing a File to HDFS

The client contacts the NameNode to check file permissions and split data into blocks.

NameNode assigns DataNodes to store the blocks.

Data is written to the first DataNode → then replicated to other DataNodes.

NameNode updates metadata about block locations.

B. Reading a File from HDFS

Client requests file metadata from the NameNode.

NameNode responds with the list of DataNodes containing the file’s blocks.

Client reads directly from the DataNodes in parallel.

Blocks are combined back into the full file at the client end.

🔹 3. Key Design Concepts

Block Replication: Default replication factor = 3 (can be customized).

Rack Awareness: Ensures replicas are stored on different racks for fault tolerance.

Heartbeat Signals: Sent from DataNodes to NameNode to confirm health.

Rebalancing: Redistributes data if nodes become unbalanced in storage.

High Availability (HA): Hadoop 2.x+ allows multiple active NameNodes to avoid single points of failure.

🔹 4. Advantages of HDFS Architecture

Handles hardware failures automatically.

Scales horizontally — add more nodes anytime.

Provides reliable, distributed data storage.

Optimized for large files and batch processing.

Anatomy of Writing and Reading Files in HDFS
📘 Concept Explanation

In HDFS, files are split into blocks (default size: 128 MB or 256 MB) and distributed across DataNodes.

Writing in HDFS:

Client requests the NameNode to store a file.

The NameNode checks if the file already exists and returns available DataNodes for block storage.

The client writes data to the first DataNode, which pipelines it to the next nodes for replication (default: 3 copies).

After successful block writes, the NameNode updates metadata (file name, block locations).

Reading in HDFS:

The client contacts the NameNode to get the block locations for a file.

The client connects to the nearest DataNode (based on network topology) and starts reading.

Data is read in parallel from multiple DataNodes for efficiency.

This process ensures fault tolerance, scalability, and high throughput — ideal for large-scale distributed processing.

Handling Read/Write Failures in HDFS
📘 Concept Explanation
HDFS is built for fault tolerance, meaning it can automatically handle hardware or software failures.

When a write failure occurs (e.g., a DataNode goes down), HDFS uses replication and acknowledgment chains to recover:

The client writes to the first DataNode → it pipelines data to others.

If any DataNode fails, the NameNode detects it through heartbeat signals.

The NameNode reassigns the block to another healthy DataNode to maintain the replication factor.

During read operations, if a DataNode fails:

The client automatically switches to another replica of the same block.

Since multiple replicas exist, data availability is not affected.

Checksum validation ensures data integrity — corrupted blocks are detected and replaced with a good copy from another replica.

This fault tolerance and self-healing mechanism make HDFS highly reliable and resilient in large clusters.

🧠 5 Quality MCQs

2. What happens when a DataNode fails during a write operation?
A) File write stops
B) Client retries with same DataNode
C) NameNode allocates a new DataNode for replication
D) Data is lost permanently

3. During a read operation, if one replica is unavailable, HDFS will:
A) Throw an error immediately
B) Try another available replica automatically
C) Wait until the failed node comes online
D) Delete the file

4. What mechanism is used by HDFS to detect data corruption?
A) Block size check
B) Data compression
C) Checksum validation
D) Heartbeat

5. The replication process in HDFS helps mainly in:
A) Increasing processing speed
B) Handling node failures and ensuring fault tolerance
C) Reducing storage usage
D) Enhancing data security through encryption

✅ Answers
B) Through missed heartbeat signals → DataNodes send regular heartbeats; missed ones indicate failure.

C) NameNode allocates a new DataNode → Maintains replication factor and fault tolerance.

B) Try another available replica automatically → Ensures continuous data access.

C) Checksum validation → Detects and replaces corrupted blocks.

B) Handling node failures and ensuring fault tolerance → Core purpose of replication in HDFS.
