Hadoop Operation Modes (Standalone, Pseudo, Cluster)
📘 Concept Explanation

Hadoop can run in three different modes depending on the configuration and purpose. Each mode serves a unique use case — from learning and testing to production deployment.

🟢 1. Standalone Mode (Local Mode)

Default mode of Hadoop (no configuration changes required).

Uses the local file system instead of HDFS.

No daemons (like NameNode or DataNode) run.

Mainly used for debugging, learning, and testing small programs.

🟡 2. Pseudo-Distributed Mode (Single-Node Cluster)

All Hadoop daemons (NameNode, DataNode, ResourceManager, NodeManager) run on a single machine.

Simulates a real Hadoop cluster on one node.

Used for development and testing of distributed processing.

🔵 3. Fully Distributed Mode (Multi-Node Cluster)

Actual production mode of Hadoop.

Daemons are distributed across multiple physical or virtual nodes.

Provides real parallel processing, scalability, and fault tolerance.

Ideal for handling large-scale big data workloads.

Mode	Daemons Running	File System Used	Use Case
Standalone	None	Local FS	Debugging / Learning
Pseudo-distributed	All on one node	HDFS	Development / Testing

Setting up a Hadoop cluster involves defining specifications (hardware, software, and network) and then configuring nodes for distributed data storage and processing.

⚙️ 1. Cluster Specification

Hadoop cluster setup depends on data volume, processing needs, and budget.
Key components include:

Component	Description
Master Node	Runs NameNode & ResourceManager; controls metadata and job scheduling.
Slave Nodes	Run DataNode & NodeManager; store and process data blocks.
Network	Gigabit or 10-Gigabit Ethernet for communication.
Storage	Large-capacity disks; use RAID for reliability.
RAM & CPU	Each node should have sufficient memory and multi-core CPU (e.g., 8–16 GB RAM, quad-core+).
🧩 2. Single-Node Cluster Setup

All Hadoop daemons (NameNode, DataNode, ResourceManager, NodeManager) run on one machine.

Useful for development, learning, and testing.

Steps:

Install Java and Hadoop.

Configure environment variables (JAVA_HOME, HADOOP_HOME).

Edit core configuration files (core-site.xml, hdfs-site.xml, etc.).

Format NameNode → Start Hadoop daemons.

Verify setup via Web UI or jps command.

🌐 3. Multi-Node Cluster Setup

Used for real-world and production systems.

Cluster has:

1 Master Node → Controls metadata and task scheduling.

Multiple Slave Nodes → Store and process actual data.

Steps:

Configure passwordless SSH between master and slaves.

Install Hadoop and Java on all nodes.

Modify configuration files to specify master and slave hostnames.

Format the HDFS filesystem on master.

Start Hadoop daemons on all nodes using start-dfs.sh and start-yarn.sh.

Verify via Hadoop Web UI (port 50070 / 8088).

Hadoop configuration defines how various components (HDFS, YARN, MapReduce) operate and communicate in the cluster. Security ensures data protection, authentication, and access control across nodes.
Both configuration and security are crucial for a stable and secure big data environment.

⚙️ 1. Hadoop Configuration Overview

Hadoop uses XML-based configuration files stored under the $HADOOP_HOME/etc/hadoop/ directory.
These files control path settings, replication, memory allocation, ports, and access permissions.

🧩 Key Configuration Files
File	Description
core-site.xml	Defines general Hadoop settings, like default filesystem URI (fs.defaultFS).
hdfs-site.xml	Configures HDFS properties like replication factor, NameNode & DataNode paths.
mapred-site.xml	Defines MapReduce framework settings such as job tracker, output directory.
yarn-site.xml	Controls YARN ResourceManager and NodeManager configurations.

Example snippet (from core-site.xml):

<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>fs.defaultFS</name>
    <value>hdfs://localhost:9000</value>
  </property>
</configuration>

🔐 2. Hadoop Security Overview

By default, Hadoop is not secure — so additional mechanisms are implemented to ensure authentication, authorization, and data confidentiality.

🧠 Main Security Mechanisms

Authentication (Kerberos):

Uses Kerberos protocol for secure identity verification.

Prevents unauthorized users from accessing Hadoop services.

Authorization:

Hadoop uses POSIX-style file permissions (read, write, execute) for directories and files in HDFS.

Example command:

hdfs dfs -chmod 750 /user/devansh


Encryption:

Data can be encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS, SSL) and at rest in HDFS.

Service-Level Security:

Enables secure communication between NameNode, DataNode, ResourceManager, and other daemons using authentication tokens.

🧰 3. Steps in Hadoop Secure Setup

Enable Kerberos Authentication in configuration.

Generate keytabs for Hadoop daemons and users.

Configure core-site.xml and hdfs-site.xml with Kerberos principals.

Restart all services for changes to take effect.

Validate secure login using kinit.

🧠 5 Quality MCQs

1. Which file defines the default Hadoop filesystem URI?

B) core-site.xml
C) yarn-site.xml
D) mapred-site.xml

2. Hadoop security is primarily based on which authentication protocol?
A) SSL
B) Kerberos
C) OAuth
D) AES

3. Which command is used to change permissions for a file in HDFS?
A) hadoop fs -copyFromLocal
B) hdfs dfs -chmod
C) hdfs dfs -mkdir
D) hadoop jar

4. What does the file yarn-site.xml configure?
A) MapReduce job parameters
B) HDFS replication factor
C) YARN ResourceManager and NodeManager settings
D) Default file system path

5. Data encryption in Hadoop ensures:
A) Faster replication
B) Secure data storage and transfer
C) Increased job scheduling speed
D) Reduced NameNode load

✅ Answers

B) core-site.xml → defines Hadoop’s default filesystem settings.

B) Kerberos → the standard Hadoop authentication protocol.

B) hdfs dfs -chmod → changes file/directory permissions.

C) yarn-site.xml → defines YARN-related configuration.

B) Encryption protects data in storage and while transferring.
